Feature X
============

This document is a template for a feature specification of the Hello
project. A real specification would have an overview of the feature
here. Copy this file and place it in doc/feature/foo.md.

## Requirements

* Bullet points of what the feature has to fulfil

## Dependency Changes

* List all new and removed dependencies to all projects (third-party and internal)
* Motivate dependency
* Remove section if no new dependencies

## API

If applicable, list the API for the feature here, otherwise remove section.

## Protocol

If applicable, describe the communication protocol, otherwise remove section.

## File Format

List all new tokens in existing files and new files, otherwise remove section.

## Examples

For larger features, pseudo-code examples of using the API. This will
serve as the basis for writing tests and to shape the API. Remove
section if not applicable.

## Implementation

Write pseudo-code of all the changes needed to implement the feature. Go
through the existing source code to do so. Group per
project/component/class.

## Issues

### 1: Shall we write down issues or not?

_Resolution: Yes:_ Writing down all major decisions at the end of a
specification helps to keep track of positive and negative decisions.

Not writing down issues safes time, but has the huge drawback of not
documenting why the alternatives considered where not chosen.
